                        If the silence talks of your own voice, it stays strong. If the silence is the one that is forced or  as a result of oppression, it has to be freed. If silence is considered as 'virtue', let us think deeply. Is it ourselves that thinks in this way or is it the society that forces you to think in that way. The silence has too many consequences and it is now up to all of us to decide when to break off the silence and when to continue the beautiful silence-ness.
